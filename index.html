                    I worked on a group project with 9 members, facing
                    challenges during deployment and frequent database errors. I
                    learned the importance of planning, coding, testing,
                    deploying, and debugging a small model before scaling up,
                    realizing that thorough initial testing saves effort in the
                    long run.

              - I have been actively involved in identifying new business
              opportunities by conducting thorough research on potential clients
              and emerging markets. This involves analyzing market trends,
              competitor strategies, and customer needs to uncover areas for
              growth and expansion. <br />

              - Building and nurturing relationships with both potential and
              existing clients has been a key focus of my role. I have dedicated
              efforts to understanding their requirements, addressing concerns,
              and providing tailored solutions to meet their business
              objectives. <br />

                - Attending networking events and conferences has been a regular
                part of my routine to promote our company and its services, as
                well as to establish valuable connections within the industry.
